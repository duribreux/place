## Introduction

This project was written as a support for my [Medium article]() and is currently running on this [website](https://place-3fcc2.web.app/#/).

## Getting Started

In order to be able to run this project, you must provide a Firebase configuration within the `dotenv` file.

```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=
FIREBASE_APP_ID=
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER=
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```

Once done you'll be able to run it as a regular flutter web app project or you can publish it using Firebase hosting solution.
